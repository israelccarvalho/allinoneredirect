Super bad link that redirect target to some page, it captures gps, photo, ip and autofill data.
Just put the code in your web server and change the url in the file saveauto.php and create a new directorie with tha name captured.
Just for educational porpose! Do not use it for criminal activities! 
I don't take any responsability on that code!
